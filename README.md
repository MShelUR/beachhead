# beachhead
This is an example of a system program for PyRVA March 14, 2018 (Pi Day)

- `beachhead.py` -- the main file for the program. It does something useful, so read the comments in some detail.
- `forkdemo.py` -- a simple use of fork & wait.
- `fname.py`, `jparse.py`, and `urutils.py` contain supporting code. I started to jam them all into one file with `beachhead`, but how useful is that?
- `Linux.Processes.pdf` -- an overly elaborate diagram explaining how Linux processes start and stop.
